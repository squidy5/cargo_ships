[entity-description]
boat=Small and fast __ENTITY__boat__ with small inventory space. Can be placed either on water ways or as an independent vehicle. Enter and leave the boat with __CONTROL__enter_ship__.
cargo_ship=Large __ENTITY__cargo_ship__ able to transport vast amount of resources. Enter and leave the ship with __CONTROL__enter_ship__.
oil_tanker=Large __ENTITY__oil_tanker__ able to transport vast amount of fluids. Enter and leave the ship with __CONTROL__enter_ship__.
ship_pump=Special pump for loading and unloading __ENTITY__oil_tanker__s. Can be placed on water. Doesn't collide with ships and needs to placed close to the __ITEM__water-way__.
oil_rig=Massive swimming extraction platform for __ENTITY__deep_oil__. Includes its own local power generation and electric network, supplying the oil rig itself as well as connected ship loading pumps with energy.
deep_oil=Large deposit of deep sea oil. Extract with the __ENTITY__oil_rig__.
port=Destinations for automated ships.
buoy=Divides the water way system into blocks, allowing multiple ships to run on the same network.
chain_buoy=Reads the next signals in the path to allow better control of ships.
bridge_north_clickable=Automated train bridge, that opens to let ships pass underneath. Requires additional buoys and signals nearby to function correctly.
