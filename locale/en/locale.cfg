[entity-description]
	boat=Small and fast boat with small inventry space. Can be placed either on water ways or as an indepedent vehicle. Enter and leave the boat with SHIFT+ENTER.
	indep-boat=Small and fast boat with small inventroy space. Can be placed either on water ways or as an indepedent vehicle. Enter and leave the boat with SHIFT+ENTER.
	cargo_ship=Large cargo ship able to ansport vast amount of resources. Enter and leave the ship with SHIFT+ENTER.
	oil_tanker=Large tanker ship able to transport vast amount of fluids. Enter and leave the ship with SHIFT+ENTER.
	ship_pump=Special pump for loading and unloading tank ships. Can be placed on water. 
	oil_rig=Massive swimming extraction platform for deep sea oil. Includes it's own local power generation and electric network, supplying the oil rig itself as well as connected ship loading pumps with energy.
	deep_oil=Large deposite of deep sea oil. Extractable with an oil rig.
	port=Destinations for automated ships.
	buoy=Divides the water way system into blocks, allowing multiple ships to run on the same network.
	chain_buoy=Reads the next signals in the path to allow better control of ships.
	bridge_north_clickable=Automated train bridge, that opens to let ships pass underneath. Recommended to use same signaling as with normal train-crossing.
	bridge_east_clickable=Automated train bridge, that opens to let ships pass underneath. Recommended to use same signaling as with normal train-crossing.
	bridge_south_clickable=Automated train bridge, that opens to let ships pass underneath. Recommended to use same signaling as with normal train-crossing.
	bridge_west_clickable=Automated train bridge, that opens to let ships pass underneath. Recommended to use same signaling as with normal train-crossing.
	bridge_base=Automated train bridge, that opens to let ships pass underneath. Place along an existing straight stretch of waterway. Recommended to use same signaling as with normal train-crossing.

[mod-setting-name]
	oil_frequency= Frequency of deep sea oil
	oil_richness= Richness of deep sea oil 
	waterway_reach_increase= Reach increase while holding Water-Ways
	no_oil_for_oil_rig= Oil Rigs can be build before chemical science

[mod-setting-description]
	waterway_reach_increase=Increase of the Players reach while holding waterways, buoys, ports, etc. Allows to place and deconstruct waterways from far away.  Set to '0' in order to disable the reach increase.
	no_oil_for_oil_rig=Makes the technology needed for building deep sea oil rigs not depend on chemical sicence. Needs to be enabled in order to progress in the game when playing wihtout land-based oil.
